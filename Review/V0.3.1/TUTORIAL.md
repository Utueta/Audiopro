# Audiopro Expert Tutorial v0.2.5

This manual provides the operational framework for using the **Audiopro Industrial System**. It covers the end-to-end workflow from hardware validation to high-precision audio auditing.

## 1. System Preparation (The Bootloader)

Before launching the application, ensure your environment meets the industrial specifications defined in the architecture.

* [cite_start]**Ollama Service**: Ensure Ollama is running locally with the `qwen2.5` model pulled for arbitration[cite: 3].
* **CUDA Drivers**: Verify that NVIDIA drivers are active to enable the `HardwareMonitorWorker` telemetry.
* [cite_start]**Database Integrity**: The system automatically initializes `audiopro_v01.db` in WAL mode upon first boot to handle concurrent I/O[cite: 4, 7].

## 2. Interface Navigation

[cite_start]The **Expert Audit Interface** is divided into three functional zones designed for obsidian-dark studio environments[cite: 5, 8].

### A. Telemetry Header
* **GPU UTIL**: Real-time percentage of GPU load.
* **VRAM USE**: Current video memory consumption. High VRAM usage (>90%) may throttle DSP pipeline performance.



### B. Analysis Grid
[cite_start]This table displays the deterministic outputs of the **DSP Subsystem**[cite: 2, 5]:
* **SNR (dB)**: Signal-to-Noise ratio. [cite_start]Higher values indicate cleaner source material[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**Clipping**: The count of digital peak distortions detected[cite: 2].
* **Suspicion**: A spectral integrity score (0.0 to 1.0). [cite_start]High scores suggest frequency capping or lossy transcoding[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**ML Class**: The label generated by the **Random Forest** incremental learner[cite: 3].

### C. Control Surface
* [cite_start]**Import Audio Library**: Opens a file dialog to queue files into the asynchronous worker pool[cite: 5].

## 3. The Audit Workflow

### Step 1: Data Ingestion
Click **Import Audio Library** and select your target directory. [cite_start]Files are hashed using **Blake2b** for traceability; duplicates are automatically identified via the repository[cite: 2, 4].

### Step 2: Asynchronous Processing
The `Manager` offloads files to the `AnalysisWorker`.
* The **DSP Pipeline** extracts raw features without blocking the UI.
* The **Machine Learning Brain** performs local inference to classify the file status.



### Step 3: Result Arbitration
[cite_start]If a file is marked as "SUSPICIOUS" by the ML model, it may trigger **Conditional LLM Arbitration**[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]The system sends metrics to the local **Qwen 2.5** model via Ollama[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]The LLM returns a final "CLEAN" or "CORRUPT" verdict with a technical justification[cite: 3].

## 4. Maintenance and Logs

[cite_start]For system diagnostics and 5-year maintenance:
* [cite_start]**System Traces**: View `logs/system.log` for hardware failures or LLM connection issues[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Analysis Traces**: View `logs/analysis.log` for detailed DSP math and pipeline errors[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Manual Health Check**: Run `python scripts/check_health.py` to verify system dependencies before an audit session.
